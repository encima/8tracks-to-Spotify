This is a userscript, written in Javascript, that converts 8tracks playlist into spotify playlist.
The task is accomplished by scraping 8tracks playlist on the page and using Spotify Metadata API to fetch Spotify links.

See demo: http://portal.sliderocket.com/BHIKP/8tracks-to-Spotify-github

Since this userscript gets the song data from 8tracks playlist by scraping the page, make sure all the songs
in the 8tracks playlist are displayed before starting the conversion. (You can achieve that by clicking the skip button multiple times.)

NOTE: For this script to work to its full potential, you need to install Yamamaya's script which enable
unlimited skipping of tracks and fetching of download links in 8tracks.
Yamamaya's script can be found here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/83206
